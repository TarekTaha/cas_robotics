# Exercise : Human-Robot Interaction/Wheelchair (intention recognition)
# A Template file that contains a set of tasks. A task is described by a
# start location, intermediate locations and the final location. At each
# location an observation from the user will be recorded, this observation
# at the moment is only the joystick input that the user gave at that
# location. This list of task will be used to generate the observation
# model to be used in solving the POMDP problem.

# <Location-1> <Observation-1> ... <Location-n><observation-n>
