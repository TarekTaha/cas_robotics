// Walker Example:
// Patient is sitting backward initially
// The walker is put in front of him (probably he can call the walker to autonomously come to him)
// The patient uses the walker to stand forward: for that to happen the walker should be in the right
// position and the readings from  one of the proximity sensors should be on (body of patient detected
// by the sensor).
// The user holds the handles and stands forward.
// The user then directs the walker and walks through out the environment assited by the walker (patient should be
// holding both handles and the user should be close to the walker.
// Patient returns to initial location
// Patient sits backward with the help of the walker.
