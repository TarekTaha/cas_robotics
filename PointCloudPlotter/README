This program manages a 3d laser scanner consisting of a Hokuyo URG 
laser scanner mounted on a Megarobotics AI motor.

The program can be compiled with the compile_scanner.sh script.  
Dependencies include OpenGL, GLUT and Playerclient.  Components include 
the zpr library for mouse-based zooming and rotating of OpenGL models, 
simpleSerialComms for communication through a serial port, and AI for 
communicating with a Megarobotics AI motor.

Player is used to communicate with the URG laser, so the URGlaser plugin 
driver is also required.  The AI motor is accessed directly via the AI 
library.
